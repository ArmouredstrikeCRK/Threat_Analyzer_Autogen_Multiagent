    "raw": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the military threat level based on this information. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the aggression analysis, the horse is standing on a hill observing its surroundings but not showing any aggressive behavior towards humans or other animals. It's in a domestic setting near a house, which suggests it's not in a combat zone. The horse might be preparing to defend itself, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a threat.\n\nNext, the object detection part shows a serene rural scene with a white horse in front of a house. There are no signs of military equipment or personnel visible. The environment is peaceful, so that lowers the threat level.\n\nThe civilian presence analysis mentions there are no civilians in the immediate area. The focus is on the horse and the setting, which doesn't indicate any military operations or combat units nearby. So, no direct threat to civilians here.\n\nLooking at the military context analysis, it's noted as training. There are uniforms visible but no weapons or insignia. The orange barrel tips suggest a training environment rather than an actual battlefield. This indicates preparation but not active aggression.\n\nThe tactical layout shows the horse is positioned near a tree for cover, which could be strategic, but without enemy forces present, there's no immediate threat. The open field offers clear lines of sight but isn't indicative of combat readiness.\n\nFinally, the equipment profiling confirms it's a training exercise with no signs of combat operations. All these factors together point to a low significance military activity in a civilian setting.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat_level\": 1,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Low significance, military equipment in a civilian setting, public display, non-combat formations.\"\n}\n```",
