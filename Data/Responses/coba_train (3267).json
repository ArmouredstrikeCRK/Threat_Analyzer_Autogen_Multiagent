    "raw": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the military threat level based on the given text. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the engagement indicators: there are no signs of anyone engaging with the tools. They seem to be displayed rather than used. That makes me think it's not a combat situation.\n\nNext, the weapons observed include an axe and two knives. The axes and knives don't show any signs of being used for fighting; they're just lying there or arranged neatly. So no combat behavior detected here.\n\nThe environmental context says these tools are on a flat surface, displayed in a way that suggests education or demonstration. Maybe it's part of a presentation or training where someone is showing off different tools.\n\nIn the military context analysis, it mentions \"Scene Type: Training.\" That's a big clue. If they're training, then it's likely related to some form of preparation, but not active combat. So that would be a lower threat level.\n\nLooking at tactical layout, there's no formation or alignment that suggests combat readiness. The tools are symmetrically placed but not in a way that would be strategic for an attack. It seems more like a static display rather than something operational.\n\nEquipment profiling mentions these tools are used in outdoor activities like camping or hiking, which again points towards non-combat use. They could be for survival skills or self-defense, but without active engagement or formation, it's not a high threat.\n\nPutting it all together: no combat behavior, training context, static display of tools. So the military significance is low. The highest threat level here would be 1 because it's in a civilian setting with some military equipment but not indicating any aggressive posture or combat readiness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat_level\": 1,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Low significance, military equipment in a civilian setting, public display, non-combat formations.\"\n}\n```",
