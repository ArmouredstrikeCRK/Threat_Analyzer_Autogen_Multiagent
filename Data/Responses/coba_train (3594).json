    "raw": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this military threat based on the given information. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the aggression analysis, individuals are in military attire and have equipment, which suggests some level of preparation. They're seated with one kneeling, maybe getting ready to move. The environment is a grassy field with an airplane in the background, so it's likely a training setting rather than an active combat situation.\n\nNext, the object detection part mentions an aircraft, but I can't access real-time info, so I'll note that it's probably military equipment or support.\n\nFor civilian presence, there's one person in a white shirt observing. They're not directly involved in combat, just assisting or watching. The proximity is safe since they're supporting rather than engaging in combat.\n\nMilitary context analysis shows this is on a military base with soldiers in uniforms and training indicators like orange barrel tips on rifles. So it's definitely a training scenario.\n\nTactical layout indicates a semi-circular formation without a front line, suggesting preparation for movement or defense but not active engagement.\n\nEquipment profiling confirms it's for training since there's no sign of combat deployment.\n\nPutting it all together: military personnel in a controlled setting, preparing with equipment, no active combat signs. So the threat level is low because it's a training exercise, not an aggressive action.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat\": 1,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Military personnel in a controlled training scenario, no active engagement.\"\n}\n```",
