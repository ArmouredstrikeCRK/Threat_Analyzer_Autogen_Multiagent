    "OBJECT_DETECTION": "A pocket knife, also known as a penknife or jackknife, is a small folding knife that can be easily carried in a pocket. Here are some key features and uses of a typical pocket knife:\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Blade**: The blade is usually made of stainless steel, carbon steel, or high-carbon steel.\n* **Handle**: The handle is typically made of wood, bone, antler, ivory, or synthetic materials like plastic or resin. Some pocket knives have decorative handles with inlays, engravings, or other embellishments.\n* **Folding Mechanism**: The blade folds into the handle when not in use, allowing for safe and convenient storage.\n\n**Uses:**\n\n* **Utility Tasks**: Pocket knives are often used for everyday tasks like opening packages, cutting rope, or slicing fruit.\n* **Outdoor Activities**: They are useful for camping, hiking, fishing, hunting, and other outdoor activities where a compact knife is necessary.\n* **Self-Defense**: Some people carry pocket knives as a means of self-defense in case of an emergency.\n\n**Common Types:**\n\n* **Drop-Point Knife**: A classic design with a curved blade that drops down when the handle is closed.\n* **Clip Point Knife**: Similar to the drop-point knife but with a more angular shape at the tip.\n* **Spear Point Knife**: Characterized by a pointed tip and straight edge.\n\n**Modern Pocket Knives:**\n\nToday's pocket knives come in various styles, materials, and features. Some popular types include:\n\n* **Locking Knives**: Feature a locking mechanism that prevents the blade from folding back into the handle.\n* **Assisted Opening Knives**: Have a spring-loaded mechanism for easy one-handed opening.\n* **Framelock Knives**: Use a metal frame or \"framelock\" to secure the blade in place.\n\nOverall, pocket knives offer a convenient and versatile tool that can be used in various situations.",

    "raw": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this military threat level based on the given information. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the aggression analysis, there's no active engagement, no visible tension, and the individual isn't showing any signs of combat behavior or hostility. The pocket knife is present but not being used as a weapon, so that doesn't indicate aggressive intent.\n\nNext, the object detection part tells me it's a pocket knife with an abalone shell handle. From what I know, pocket knives are usually for everyday use or outdoor activities, not necessarily related to military aggression.\n\nThe civilian presence analysis is tricky because there's not enough context. The background is a carpeted floor, which doesn't suggest a combat setting. Without more info, it's hard to say if this is a military or civilian scenario.\n\nLooking at the military context analysis, it mentions training and the knife being a tool for close quarters combat training. That makes me think this might be related to military exercises rather than an actual threat.\n\nThe tactical layout points out that the knife is centrally positioned without any opponents or threats. It's stationary, so no active engagement is happening here. The formation isn't clear because it's just one object, but if I imagine a scenario where the knife is part of a larger setup, maybe it's for defense or an ambush.\n\nEquipment profiling shows it's a utility tool used in training. No other military gear is visible, which suggests this is more about preparation rather than an actual threat.\n\nPutting all this together: no combat behavior, just a pocket knife in a training context. So the threat level should be low because there's no indication of real aggression or military action.\n</think>\n\n0",
